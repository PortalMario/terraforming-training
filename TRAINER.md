This document is used by a trainer to guide the training for each part of the hands-on section. Each task is designed to build upon the previous one. For each hands-on section, the trainee needs to create a copy of the last completed exercise. The new copy will then be modified for the next exercise.

# 01-Basic
### How?
- Together with the group, step by step. (copy paste)

**NOTE: Different container names and ports!**

### Bullet Points
- Provider Documentation (Required Parameters)
- Terraform Documentation
- Line-by-Line Explanation
- Terraform Blocks and Backends
- Plan, Apply
- State Handling, State Drift
- Validate, Fmt
- Full Destroy with commenting
- Explain dependencies (between image and container)
- State Pull

# 02-Vars
### How?
- Together with the group, step by step. 

### Bullet Points
- Declaration of variables 
- Different ways of providing variables
- Using variables
- Sensitive variables
- **Show variable looping next (Presentation)**

# 02a-Vars
### How?
- Each trainee works individually.
- Post the looping example from the presentation.
- Everyone must remove the resource: `docker_image`.
- Variable declaration should be completed but can be set to any value.
- Explain iteration limitations (only maps).

### Bullet Points
- **Show exercise in presentation**

# 03-Output
### How?
- Together with the group, step by step. 

### Bullet Points
- Why are outputs useful? (Processing them in other contexts)
- Sensitive outputs
- State relevance

# 03a-Output
### How?
- Interactively. 
- Everyone must revert to the version used for variable iteration (so only the resource `docker_container` exists, with the working `for_each`).
- Everyone should now add an output block as before. (It needs to output a value generated by the resource `docker_container`—see provider documentation.)
- An error will be encountered and should be fixed together. (Why is this error occurring?)

### Bullet Points
- HCL Syntax
- Outputs are crucial for Terragrunt dependencies
- Local Blocks (Short side note)
- **Show TFLOG at the end**

# 04-Modules
### How?
- Together with the group, step by step. 

### Bullet Points
- Why use modules, and what are modules?
- Build a module for `docker_container` together.
- Variable handling in modules.
- Outputs in modules.
- **Outputs from a module to the root module—use `container_id` as an example output! (Variables and iteration must be removed for this. Everyone should remove them together with the trainer.)**
- Show the class output of a module from within the root module. (Each student must replicate this.)
- Draw a flowchart at the end  (Trainer) (Draw a diagram illustrating how the output is passed to the root module and subsequently transferred into another module as a variable.)

# 04a-Modules
### How?
- Each trainee works individually.
- The group must see how an output from the `docker_container` module is accessed from the root module and how to pass variables to a module from the root module beforehand.
- Iteration must be removed from all resources.
- Variables should be removed, and all values hardcoded.

### Bullet Points
- **Show exercise in presentation**
- Show Terraform dependencies (modules, resources, and `depends_on` block).
- VS Code Extension!

# 05-Terragrunt
### How?
- Together with the group, step by step. 

### Bullet Points
- Split variables into multiple stages.
- Show documentation.
- Wrapper.
- Show the difference between `.tfvars` and Terragrunt.
- **Demonstrate how to include `terragrunt.hcl` files.**

# 05a-Terragrunt
### How?
- Each trainee works individually.

### Bullet Points
- **Show exercise in presentation.**
